# Municipal Council Chatbot

## Overview
The Municipal Council Chatbot is an AI-powered conversational interface designed to facilitate communication between citizens and the local government. Built using the Rasa framework, the chatbot allows citizens to inquire about municipal services, report issues, seek information about events or policies, and provide feedback conveniently through a messaging interface.

## Problem Statement
The municipal council faces challenges in efficiently addressing citizens' inquiries, processing service requests, and collecting feedback. Traditional communication channels such as phone calls and emails may result in delays, while navigating through the council's website can be cumbersome for users. To address these challenges, the council aims to develop a chatbot that provides quick and accurate responses to citizens' queries, streamlines service delivery processes, and enhances citizen engagement.

## Business Understanding
### Objectives:
- **Minimize Response Time**: Reduce the time taken to address citizens' inquiries and service requests by providing an instant response through the chatbot interface.
- **Minimize Manual Intervention**: Automate repetitive tasks such as providing information about services, policies, and events, reducing the need for manual intervention from council staff.
- **Maximize Citizen Engagement**: Improve citizen engagement by providing a user-friendly and accessible channel for communication with the municipal council, encouraging citizens to interact, provide feedback, and stay informed about local initiatives.

### Requirements:
- **Python Version**: 3.10

## Features
- **Intent Recognition**: The chatbot recognizes user intents (e.g., inquiries, service requests, feedback) using natural language understanding (NLU) capabilities.
- **Entity Extraction**: Relevant entities (e.g., service types, issue descriptions) are extracted from user messages to provide personalized responses.
- **Dialogue Management**: Conversation flows and dialogue management rules guide the interaction between the chatbot and users, ensuring a seamless experience.
- **Backend Integration**: Integration with backend systems enables the chatbot to fetch real-time information about municipal services, events, and policies.
- **Training and Evaluation**: The chatbot is trained using annotated data to improve its NLU and dialogue management capabilities, with performance evaluation conducted regularly.
- **Deployment**: The chatbot is deployed on messaging platforms such as Facebook Messenger, Slack, or the council's website to make it accessible to citizens.
